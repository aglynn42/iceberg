I will perform a checkout of a new branch starting from the current reference commit. 
This way, by changing the HEAD into something that fits the image, my repository will be attached and repository will be able to perform commits and all regular operations.

I'm active when: 
	- working copy is detached 
	- repository HEAD is detached
