I'm a diff panel that shows packages/classes/methods changed in a column and a diff in the other.
I give users the possibility of select changes.  

By default, all my elements are selected on opening.

As my father, I receive a model that needs to understand #elements.
also #elements answer should be a collection of elements that also understand elements.
