I am an abstract class representing an IceDefinition that is a container of methods. I.e., a class, a trait or an extension.

I have a name which is the name of the container I represent. If I'm meta-side, I add to my name a suffix class. For example: Integer class.

I also contain the monticello definition that corresponds to me.

See my super/subclasses for more information.
