I'm the general announcer of Iceberg.
I'm an announcer that knows how to suspend just some kind of announcements (the ones that matches matching block on #suspendAllMatching:while:).

In current implementation of Iceberg, I will be used mainly for the convenience method: #suspendAllForRepository:while:
