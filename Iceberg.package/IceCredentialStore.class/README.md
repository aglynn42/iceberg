I am the responsible for storing the credentials. 
Now I can store plain text credentials and SSH key pairs. 

I store the credentials in a fuel file, this is non encrypted. So it should be improved later.

There is a default instance that stores the credentials in a file per image, in the pharo-local directory.
In the settings you can modify the location of the credentials file.
